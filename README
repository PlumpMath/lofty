Introduction
------------

Application-Building Components (ABC) is a class library for C++11 designed and
written with these principles in mind:

•  Compatibility with C++11 STL;
•  Extended run-time debugging support, with aims to reach or exceed that of
   languages such as Java or Python, featuring full stack traces (including
   arguments and locals) and a diversified and semantically rich exception class
   hierarchy;
•  Modern I/O and IPC classes, inspired by Python’s library;
•  Portability to some of the most common operating systems;
•  Full support for text-based or GUI applications;
•  Transactional operation wherever/whenever possible;
•  Compiler-enforced type safety (no void pointers, no pre-C++11-style variadic
   functions).





Coding and formatting style
---------------------------

Check quotes style:
	grep -Rn "[A-Za-z]'[A-Za-z]" src include tools
	grep -Rn ' "[A-Za-z]' src include tools
	grep -Rn '[A-Za-z]" ' src include tools

Check that initializations are done using constructor syntax instead of
assignment:
	grep -Rn ' [_A-Za-z0-9]\+ = ' src include tools

Check that integer conversions don’t use static_cast:
	grep -Rn 'static_cast<[_ 0-9A-Za-z]\+>' src include tools
